This project we are creating a dashboard that utilizes HTML and CSS to help visualize the pages. Included in this is a landing page, visualization pages, comparisons page, and a data page. The landing page is the main hub to access the other pages and also has a summary about the purpose of the data posted. The visualization pages show different graphs from data collected that was utilized on a different project. The comparisons page has all of the graphs from the different visualization pages all in one place to see at once. Finally, the data page visualizes a csv file that has been uploaded.
